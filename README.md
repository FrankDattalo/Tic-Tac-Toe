This repository will contain code written in Java 5+ that will never lose to a human in tic-tac-toe if the computer moves first.
It uses a minimax algorithm to compute the best possible move at each board position.

This project was made as an experiment with minimax algorithms and computer implementation of mathematical concepts.
